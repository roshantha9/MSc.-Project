        Hi!

        This archive (ADPCMSRC.ZIP) contains the source code for
        ADPCM 4:1 coder and decoder, for both mono sample data
        (the original code) and stereo data (my modification).

        The files in this archive are:

        ADPCM.SH        The original net message, containing ADPCM
                        coder and decoder in a shell archive for
                        Sun etc. workstations.

        ADPCM.C         Mono ADPCM 4:1 coder and decoder (for IBM PC
                        compatible machines).

        ADPCM.H         Header file for mono ADPCM compression.

        TESTC.C         Test mono compressor source.

        TESTD.C         Test mono decoder source.

        ADPCM_S.C       Stereo ADPCM 4:1 coder and decoder source
                        (Modified from ADPCM.C by Patrick Aalto).

        TESTC_S.C       Test stereo compressor source.

        TESTD_S.C       Test stereo decoder source.

        I cannot assume any copyrights or such for my modifications,
        since they were such a trivial add-on to the original
        algorithm.
